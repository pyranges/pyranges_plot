Pyranges Plot documentation
===========================

Pyranges Plot is a Python library specifically tailored to perform
along Pyranges<https://github.com/pyranges/pyranges_1.x.git>`_ objects. It provides
user-friendly and customizable visualizations for genomic intervals datasets, a perfect
tandem for Pyranges' efficient and intuitive genomic data manipulation methods.

Plots can be produced in an interactive interface or in batch production, allowing easy
data exploration as well as generation of high quality and reproducible figures. These plots
can be based on either of two engines: Matplotlib and Plotly, to be defined by the user.
